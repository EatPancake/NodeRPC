# NodeRPC
Node RPC allows you to set custom statuses for discord
currently, to change any of the settings, edit the config file

I'm just working on this project for fun. It's nothing crazy.

### Dependencies 
[NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en)
[discord-rpc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord-rpc)
```npm i discord-rpc```
